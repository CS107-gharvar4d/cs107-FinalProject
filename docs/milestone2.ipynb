It integrates a set of techniques\nto evaluate the derivative of various mathematical expressions.\n\nBeing able to take derivatives has many important practical applications across a variety of domains.\nIn physics, the first order derivative tells us the rate of change, while further orders can tell us\nmore pieces of information like acceleration and actergy. In statistics, applications include Bayesian\ninference and the training of neural networks. In economics, taking the derivative of profit and utility\nfunctions allows agents to maximize their expected outcomes. These are only a few instances wherein \ndifferentiating complex functions is useful and necessary.\n\nGiven the broad set of applications across domains, we hope ADG4 can be a useful tool\nthat can facilitate quick and easy numerical evaluation of derivatives through computing.\n\n\n# Background\n\n\nThe methodology behind our package relies on the fact that every function can be computed as\na combination of simple elementary functions, which have simple derivatives (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.).\nBy applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives (or more generally, \nJacobian matries) of arbitrary functions can automatically calculated. \n\nThe basic functions of our package are based on the forward mode of auto differentiation.\nThe forward mode takes the first step as putting in seeding variables at the place of each\nindependent variable, and then recursively move forward following the chain rule to \ncombine all the sub-expressions to get the final derivatives. In other words, forward mode\ninvolves repeatedly substituting the derivatives of the inner functions in the chain rule.\nWe are going to leverage dual numbers to operate the forward mode automatic differentiation, \nwhich are vectors containing a function value and derivative. The algebra of dual numbers is \nexactly analogous to the forward accumulation process of calculating the derivatives following\nthe chain rule.\n\n\nAs opposed to forward mode, reverse mode is another way of calculating automatic differentiation,\nwhich can be a helpful extension of our package. Reverse method takes the first step as\ncalculating the derivatives of the outermost functions, and then using the chain rule to \nrecursively calculate the derivatives of the inner functions, until it gets to each \nindependent variables, where the seeding variables would be put in.\n\nHere are a few important concepts pertaining AD which are mentioned above:\n\nThe Chain Rule: the derivative of a convoluted function is the product of each simple function evaluated at the value of its child function.\nJacobian: the gradient of each element of a function's output with respect to each and every input. In other words, it's the gradient of the function at the space spanned by the inputs.\nDual numbers: a two dimentional space where a outer product is defined between any vectors x\\ =\\ (a,\\ b)x = (a, b) and y\\ =\\ (c,\\ d)y = (c, d) as x\\times y\\ =\\ (a\\cdot c,\\ a\\cdot d\\ +\\ c\\cdot b)x×y = (a⋅c, a⋅d + c⋅b). Dual number is useful when we want to include a second-order calculation, i.e., not only calculate the value of a function, but also its changes with regard to small changes from the inputs.\n\n\n# How to use\n\nWe envision a three-step user-software interaction:\n- Download and install: the package will be distributed through PyPI. A user should download it and install it along with all other needed packages automatically.\nSome code like the following can be used to import the libraries:\n\n   `import ADG4`\n\n\n### Example\n\n- An example of the user interface for how to use the package is below:\n\n```\nfrom ADG4.advar import ADVariable\nfrom ADG4.admath import cos\n\nx = ADVariable(1)\ny = ADVariable(2)\nz = x + (2 * y) # behind the scenes this calls the Add ADFunction and the mul ADFunction respectively\n\nz.get_deriv(wrt=x) # returns 1\nz.get_deriv(wrt=y) # returns 2\n\nz.derivs # contains {x: 1, y : 2}, eg dx and dy\nz.val # contains 5\n\ncos(z)\n```\n\n- Functional inputs: A class should be called to instantiate the object. The constructor requires the following inputs: a list of function inputs as declaration, a list of input values, a function form (methods for repetition and recursion should be provided in preparation of cases like f = x1 x2 ... x100000)\n- Jacobian: Lastly, the function returns to the Jacobian matrix. \n\nAdds-on: solution to a three-body interaction dataset. The dataset provides the trajectories of the three bodies. Function returns to the mass ratios.\n\n\n# Software Organization\n\nThis section addresses how we plan to organize our software package.\n\nWhat will the directory structure look like?\n* Directory will be structured based on functionality. Modules will be deployed according to program features such as mathematic calculations, user interface, computational graph and unit tests.\n* A primary influence on the directory structure is that if we want it to be pip installable, we'll need a general format that looks like this:\n\n```\nADG4/\nad_extension/ # name TBD\ntests/\ndocs/\nsetup.py\nREADME.md\n```\n\n\n* We will have a unittest test file per implementation file.\n\n```\nADG4/\n\tadvar.py\n\tadmath.py\nad_extension/\n\textension.py\ntests/\n\ttest_advar.py\n\ttest_admath.py\n\ttest_extension.py\ndocs/\n\thowto.md\nsetup.py\nREADME.md\n```\n\nWhat modules do you plan on including? What is their basic functionality?\n* For now, we plan of having two models: `ADG4` for implementing our core AD functionality and `ad_extension` which will use our core library for an end-user program.\n* We are also considering the use of third-party libraries or modules at this time. This will help us support specific features of the project, but nothing specific has been defined yet. But we most probably consider numpy or scipy for data structures and basic operators. We'd like to use numpy . Numpy is a mathematical computation library that makes it easy to build interactions between scalars, vectors, and matrices. It has built in support for matrix/vector math which will be useful for our final implementation and is accessible by running the following:\n```\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\nWhere will your test suite live? Will you use TravisCI? CodeCov?\n* Yes we plan to use both TravisCI and CodeCov. \n* The project will leverage the unittest module to test, and will live in a separate directory structure as seen above. The test suite will be run automatically via TravisCI everytime we push a change into our branch. Each time code is pushed, they both will run all the tests in the `tests/` dir. Possibly with `python -m unittest tests/`\nHow will you distribute your package (e.g. PyPI)?\n* We intend to distribute our package via PyPI. For the moment will do do so via git clone or forking the project, as well as, ake it friendly to use on different environments such as conda, virtualenv, etc.\n* We are interested in designing the package to be in the pip package format so that it could be installed via PyPI or via `git clone` then `pip install`.\n* Our main usage within our team will be with the command `pip install --editable [project repo location]`. This creates a local pip package that we can continue to live edit and interact with.\n\nHow will you package your software? Will you use a framework? If so, which one and why? If not, why not?\n* We will use SetupTools (setup.py) to package our software. That way it can handle downloading dependencies and setup processes.\n\nOther considerations?\n* As noted in the project instructions we will also include a broader impact statement for our library. This will consider the accessibility of our software library to different groups of people and ensure that it is accessible and usable to a wide and representative population.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe core data structure is an ADVariable which maintains two core pieces of data:\nthe current value, and the the current trace for *all* previously involved variables.\nEg the partial derivatives with respect to each input variable.\n\n\n## Core Classes \n### ADVariable\n```\nADVariable\n  fields:\n    - val: the currently computed value\n    - derivs: a dictionary that maps inputs -> partial derivatives\n  methods:\n    - get_deriv(wrt=None)\n    - __mul__, __add__, .. call the associated ADFunctions to return new ADVariables\n```\n\n### Managing derivatives\nAt any point, the method `get_deriv(wrt=v)` can be called on an ADVariable to get the derivative with respont to any input\n\n\n## ADFunctions\nADFunctions accept one or more ADVariables and output a new ADVariable with an updated `val` and `derivs`.\n```\nADFunction\n  input: One or more ADVariables\n  output: A new ADVariable with appropriate val, deriv\n```\n\n### ADFunction Implementations\nSince ADFunctions do not contain internal state, for now it seems to make the most sense to have them as direct functions.\nElementary functions like sin, cos, etc will each have a corresponding `ADFunction` implementation that stores gradients\nand maintains logic depending on whether the input is a vector, matrix etc. For functions such as multiplication and addition,\nwhich have implicit functionality in Python, we will overwrite the underlying dunder method so that when called upon an `ADVariable`,\nthese functions will evaluate and update the derivatives as described above.\n\nNo external dependencies are required at this time.\n\n\n### Vectors, Matrices\nA Vector is a `list(ADVariables)` and a matrix is a `list(list(ADVariables))`.\nIf each `ADFunction` handles the four input types:\n- Scalar\n- ADVariable\n- list(ADVariable)\n- list(list(ADVariable))\n\nWe anticipate that our program will be able to support these instances.\n\n####  Vectors, Matrices example:\n\n```\nv = [ ADVariable(1) for i in range(4)] # a vector of length 4\nz = v + 2\n```\n\n```\nAdd(v1, v2)\n - if v1 is scalar -> ...\n ...\n - if v1 is vector -> ..\n```\n\n### Example Code Structure\nAll functions will return a new ADVariable with an updated value and list of derivatives with respect to variables.\n\nFor example, below is an example of how we might implement a function for addition, which would perform the elementary operation of adding two ADVariables and calculating the updated derivatives.\n\n```\ndef add(first, second):\n\tval = first.val + second.val\n\tderivs = {}\n\n    # Update trace for the first item\n\tfor element, element_deriv in first.derivs.items():\n\t\tderivs[element] = element_deriv\n\n    # Update trace for the second item\n\tfor element, element_deriv in second.derivs.items():\n\t\tderivs[element] = element_deriv\n\n\tn = ADVariable(val=val, derivs=derivs)\n\treturn n\n```\n\nBelow is another example of how we might implement a function for multiplying two scalars, again performing the elementary operation and calculating the derivatives.\n```\ndef mul_scalar(first, scalar):\n\tval = first.val * scalar\n\tderivs = {}\n\tfor element, element_deriv in first.derivs.items():\n\t\tderivs[element] = element_deriv * scalar\n\n\tn = ADVariable(val=val, derivs=derivs)\n\treturn n\n```\n\nADVariables will track their trace within the `derivs` variable, as can be seen in the sample implementation below. An example of this implementation can be seen below. On an ADVariable, the method `get_deriv` allows the user to extract the derivative of that ADVariable, either as the full Jacobian or with respect to an argument variable.\nWe also can overwrite dunder methods such as `__add__` to use our written functions so that our package can operate on ADVariables using `+` and other built-in syntax.\n```\nclass ADVariable:\n\n\tdef __init__(self, val, derivs={}):\n\t\tself.val = val\n\t\tself.derivs = derivs\n\t\tself.derivs[self] = 1\n\n\tdef get_deriv(self, wrt=None):\n\t\tif not wrt:\n\t\t\treturn self.derivs\n\t\treturn self.derivs[wrt]\n\n\tdef __add__(self, other):\n\t\treturn add(self, other)\n\n\tdef __repr__(self):\n\t\treturn f'ADVariable(val={self.val})'\n```\n\n# Software Organization\n\nThis section addresses how we plan to organize our software package.\n\nWhat will the directory structure look like?\n* Directory will be structured based on functionality.

Based on the comments from our TF Simon, our Introduction and Background sections were good. In terms of constructive feedback:\n* He recommended taking some of the codeblocks we define later and including them as examples in the 'How to Use' section.\n* In the Software Organization section, he recommended that we break apart each answer to the questions asked explicitly, and show the potential directory structure.\n* There is also opportunity to clean up the Implementation section a bit.\n\n#### Response\nTo address this feedback, we took the following steps:\n* Moved code blocks into How to Use section to clarify demos.\n* Revised Software Organization section to more clearly address each question and include directory structure.\n* Cleaned up the Implementation section.","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-3be1defb-428f-4af8-8fd7-8c0ac6302600"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"af33b132-ce02-46f2-bd25-2b1c4ac75e7e","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
