It integrates a set of techniques\nto evaluate the derivative of various mathematical expressions.\n\nBeing able to take derivatives has many important practical applications across a variety of domains.\nIn physics, the first order derivative tells us the rate of change, while further orders can tell us\nmore pieces of information like acceleration and actergy. In statistics, applications include Bayesian\ninference and the training of neural networks. In economics, taking the derivative of profit and utility\nfunctions allows agents to maximize their expected outcomes. These are only a few instances wherein \ndifferentiating complex functions is useful and necessary.\n\nGiven the broad set of applications across domains, we hope ADG4 can be a useful tool\nthat can facilitate quick and easy numerical evaluation of derivatives through computing.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-5a2e48ad-2c7e-4a25-952a-2c85cfead18e"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Background\n\n\nThe methodology behind our package relies on the fact that every function can be computed as\na combination of simple elementary functions, which have simple derivatives (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.).\nBy applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives (or more generally, \nJacobian matries) of arbitrary functions can automatically calculated. \n\nThe basic functions of our package are based on the forward mode of auto differentiation.\nThe forward mode takes the first step as putting in seeding variables at the place of each\nindependent variable, and then recursively move forward following the chain rule to \ncombine all the sub-expressions to get the final derivatives. In other words, forward mode\ninvolves repeatedly substituting the derivatives of the inner functions in the chain rule.\nWe are going to leverage dual numbers to operate the forward mode automatic differentiation, \nwhich are vectors containing a function value and derivative. The algebra of dual numbers is \nexactly analogous to the forward accumulation process of calculating the derivatives following\nthe chain rule.\n\n\nAs opposed to forward mode, reverse mode is another way of calculating automatic differentiation,\nwhich can be a helpful extension of our package. Reverse method takes the first step as\ncalculating the derivatives of the outermost functions, and then using the chain rule to \nrecursively calculate the derivatives of the inner functions, until it gets to each \nindependent variables, where the seeding variables would be put in.\n\n\n\nHere are a few important concepts pertaining AD which are mentioned above:\n- The Chain Rule: the derivative of a convoluted function is the product of each simple\n function evaluated at the value of its child function.\n- Jacobian: the gradient of each element of a function's output with respect to each and every input. In other words, \nit's the gradient of the function at the space spanned by the inputs.\n- Dual numbers: a two dimentional space where a outer product is defined between any vectors $$x\\ =\\ (a,\\ b)$$ and $$y\\ =\\ (c,\\ d)$$ as $$x\\times y\\ =\\ (a\\cdot c,\\ a\\cdot d\\ +\\ c\\cdot b)$$.\n Dual number is useful when we want to include a second-order calculation, \n i.e., not only calculate the value of a function, but also its changes with regard to small changes from the inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-0bebe360-0ea3-436d-ac3a-a2ffcca262a8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# How to use\n\nWe envision a three-step user-software interaction:\n- Download and install: the package will be distributed through PyPI.

The constructor requires the following inputs: a list of function inputs as declaration, a list of input values, a function form (methods for repetition and recursion should be provided in preparation of cases like f = x1 x2 ... x100000)\n- Jacobian: Lastly, the function returns to the Jacobian matrix. \n\nAdds-on: solution to a three-body interaction dataset.
