    "Being able to take derivatives has many important practical applications across a variety of domains.\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology behind our package relies on the fact that every function can be computed as\n",
    "a combination of simple elementary functions, which have simple derivatives (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.).\n",
    "By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives (or more generally, \n",
    "Jacobian matries) of arbitrary functions can automatically calculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic functions of our package are based on the forward mode of auto differentiation.\n",
    "The forward mode takes the first step as putting in seeding variables at the place of each\n",
    "independent variable, and then recursively move forward following the chain rule to \n",
    "combine all the sub-expressions to get the final derivatives. In other words, forward mode\n",
    "involves repeatedly substituting the derivatives of the inner functions in the chain rule.\n",
    "We are going to leverage dual numbers to operate the forward mode automatic differentiation, \n",
    "which are vectors containing a function value and derivative. The algebra of dual numbers is \n",
    "exactly analogous to the forward accumulation process of calculating the derivatives following\n",
    "the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to forward mode, reverse mode is another way of calculating automatic differentiation,\n",
    "which can be a helpful extension of our package. Reverse method takes the first step as\n",
    "calculating the derivatives of the outermost functions, and then using the chain rule to \n",
    "recursively calculate the derivatives of the inner functions, until it gets to each \n",
    "independent variables, where the seeding variables would be put in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few important concepts pertaining AD which are mentioned above:\n",
    "- The Chain Rule: the derivative of a convoluted function is the product of each simple\n",
    " function evaluated at the value of its child function.\n",
    "- Jacobian: the gradient of each element of a function's output with respect to each and every input. In other words, \n",
    "it's the gradient of the function at the space spanned by the inputs.\n",
    "- Dual numbers: a two dimentional space where a outer product is defined between any vectors $$x\\ =\\ (a,\\ b)$$ and $$y\\ =\\ (c,\\ d)$$ as $$x\\times y\\ =\\ (a\\cdot c,\\ a\\cdot d\\ +\\ c\\cdot b)$$.\n",
    " Dual number is useful when we want to include a second-order calculation, \n",
    " i.e., not only calculate the value of a function, but also its changes with regard to small changes from the inputs.\n",
